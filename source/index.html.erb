          <p>
            31 year old American currently residing in Tokyo, Japan. I've been
            here for about six years, not including my student exchange experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since I graduated university I've been teaching English in Japan
            since 2013 in various places. However in the last year or two I've
            really been focusing on getting out of the education industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's because of one of the friends I made living in Aormori, Japan
            that I became interested in programming and now, after a lot of self
            studying, I'm actively searching for webdevelopment positions in
            Tokyo.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm able to speak Japanese to a JLPT N3 level and do intend on
            obtaining the N1 certification once I've successfully transitioned
            careers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm very interested in weight training and fitness and have always
            strived to improve myself not only physically, but also mentally.
          </p>
